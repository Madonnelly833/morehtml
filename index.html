      The Watersnoodmuseum (or Flood Museum) in Ouwerkerk, the Netherlands, is the "National Knowledge and Remembrance Centre for the Floods of 1953" and offers an in-depth picture of the events during and after the flood of 1 February 1953. The museum was officially opened on 2 April 2001. The museum also educates visitors about water safety, and the museum collects global knowledge about flooding. The museum is located in the dike south of the village of Ouwerkerk; it is housed in the four caissons used to close the last gap in the dike following the flood.
